## Description
My thesis project
## Quick start
### Create features vector
`make_dataset.py` creates the file `data/dataset.csv` with features for matrices from `data/matrices.csv`.

### Train neural network
`train.py` train neural network on dataset `data/dataset.csv`. There are several datasets with different amount of lines in the directory `data/`
